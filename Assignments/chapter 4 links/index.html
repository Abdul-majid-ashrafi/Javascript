<p>
    Think about the stories you
    read in a newspaper: for each
    story, there will be a headline,
    some text, and possibly some
    images.  <br/>
    If the article is a long
    piece, there may be subheadings
    that split the story into separate
    sections or quotes from those
    involved. Structure helps readers
    understand the stories in the
    newspaper.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The structure is very similar
    when a news story is viewed
    online (although it may also
    feature audio or video).  <br/>
    This is
    illustrated on the right with a
    copy of a newspaper alongside
    the corresponding article on its
    website.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Now think about a very different
    type of document â€” an
    insurance form. Insurance forms
    often have headings for different
    sections, and each section
    contains a list of questions with
    areas for you to fill in details or
    checkboxes to tick.
    <br/>Again, the
    structure is very similar online.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The use of headings and
    subheadings in any document
    often reflects a hierarchy of
    information.  <br/>
    For example, a
    document might start with
    a large heading, followed by
    an introduction or the most
    important information.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This might be expanded upon
    under subheadings lower down
    on the page. When using a word
    processor to create a document,
    we separate out the text to give
    it structure. Each topic might
    have a new paragraph, and each
    section can have a heading to
    describe what it covers. <br/>

    On the right, you can see a
    simple document in Microsoft
    Word.  <br/>
    The different styles for
    the document, such as different
    levels of heading, are shown
    in the drop down box. If you
    regularly use Word, you might
    have also used the formatting
    toolbar or palette to do this.

<h3 id="html">1: HT ML</h3>
<p>
    We will spend the first chapter
    looking at how HTML is used to
    create web pages. You will see
    that you start by writing down
    the words you want to appear
    on your page.  <br/>
    You then add tags
    or elements to the words so
    that the browser knows what is
    a heading, where a paragraph
    begins and ends, and so on.
    The rest of this section
    introduces the tags you have
    at your disposal to create web
    pages, grouped into chapters on:
    text, lists, links, images, tables,
    forms, video audio and flash, and
    miscellaneous elements. <br/>
    I should warn you that the
    examples in the first nine
    chapters are not exciting to look
    at, yet they are the foundation of
    every web page. The following
    chapters on CSS will show you
    how to make your pages look a
    lot more interesting.
</p>

<h3 id="css">2: CSS</h3>
<p>
    We start this section with a
    chapter that explains how CSS
    uses rules to enable you to
    control the styling and layout
    of web pages. We then go on to
    look at the wide variety of CSS
    properties you can use in your
    CSS rules.  <br/>
    These properties
    generally fall into one of two
    categories: <br/>
    Presentation: <br/>
    How to control
    things like the color of text, the
    fonts you want to use and the
    size of those fonts, how to add
    background colors to pages (or
    parts of a page), and how to add
    background images.
    Layout: How to control where
    the different elements are
    positioned on the screen. You
    will also learn several techniques
    that professionals use to make
    their pages more attractive
</p>
<h3 id="practical">3: Practical</h3>
<p>information that will assist you in
    building better websites.
    We look at some new tags that
    will be introduced in HTML5 to
    help describe the structure of
    your pages. HTML5 is the latest
    version of HTML (still under
    development at the time of
    writing).  <br/>
    Before learning about
    these elements, you need a good
    grasp of how CSS is used to
    control the design of web pages.
    There is a chapter that talks you
    through a design process that
    you might like to follow when
    creating a new website. <br/>
    Finally, we end up looking at
    topics that will help you once
    you have built your site, such
    as putting it on the web, search
    engine optimisation (SEO) and
    using analytics software to track
    who comes to your site and what
    they are looking at.</p>
