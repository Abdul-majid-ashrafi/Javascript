<h1>Assignment 5: Images</h1>
<p>
There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: <br>
you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart. There are several things to consider when selecting and 
<br> preparing images for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more 
attractive and professional. In this chapter you will learn how to:

<p>These pages demonstrate exactly how your browser handles the ALIGN attribute in an IMG tag. </br> 
<b>LEFT</b> This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).</br> 
<b>RIGHT</b> This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).

There are around   10,000 living species of Picture that inhabit   different ecosystems from the Arctic to the   Antarctic. Many species undertake long distance   annual migrations, and many more perform shorter   irregular journeys.

The features that VS Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. </br></br>
VS Code's rich extensibility model lets extension authors plug directly into the VS Code UI and contribute functionality through the same APIs used by VS Code. This topic explains how to find, install, and manage VS Code extensions.

<td>I will use it as a link to the first hTML assignment page. To replace

the text in the link above with the tedlogo.gif image, you simply replace

the text that would appear on the page with an image command calling for

the tedlogo.gif image.</td>

<tr align=TOP>

<td>First, the image is placed on the page with the "img" tag. "SRC," which

simply means "source," tells the computer where the image we want is located.

The "img" tag is then sorrounded with the "a href" tag linking it to the

first assignment page.</td>



<td>Go ahead, place your pointer over the image. It's active and it points

to the first hTML assignment page. You're done... Almost.</td>

<tr align=CENTER>

<td>Look at the image above. See the blue border around it? That happens

when you make an image active. Remember that when you make text into a

link, that it turns blue? Well, that's what happens here. If you like it-->

<!--- great. You're done. I think it looks unprofessional in some cases. I

get rid of it.</td>

<tr>

<td>Notice all I did was add the command border="0" inside the image command,

right between the img and the SRC. That sets the blue border around the

active image to zero. Now, if you'd like, you can go the complete opposite-->

<!--way and write in border="50". That will give you a huge blue border.-->

<!--<P>Lay your pointer on the image - it's still active, but no blue. That-->

<h3>

More Commands</h3>

You can add any of the following commands using the same format as the

border command:

<table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=5 width="400" BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0" >

<tr>

<td align=RIGhT align=TOP><B>width</B></td>



<td>a numeric value that specifies the width (in pixels) you would like

the image to be.

<P>e.g. <B>width="258"</B></td>

</tr>



<tr>-->

<!--<td align=RIGhT align=TOP><B>height</B></td>-->



<!--<td>a numeric value that specifies the height (in pixels) you would like-->

<!--the image to be.

<P>e.g. <B>height="147"</B></td>

</tr>



<tr>

<td align=RIGhT align=TOP><B>align</B></td>



<td>this command can take the value of either LEFT or RIGhT depending on

where you want the image to be aligned on the page.

<P>e.g. <B>align="RIGhT"</B></td>-->
